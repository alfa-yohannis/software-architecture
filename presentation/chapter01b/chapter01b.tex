	\begin{frame}{Defining Software Architecture}
	Software architecture consists of four components:
	\begin{itemize}
	
	\item Structure (Architecture styles used)
	\begin{itemize}
	\item Structure refers to the type of architecture styles used in the system support.
	\end{itemize}
	
	\item Architecture characteristics 
	\begin{itemize}
	\item Architecture characteristics refers to the ``-ilities'' that the system must, e.g., availability, reliability, scalability, security, testability, etc. 
	\end{itemize}
	
	\item Architecture decisions
	\begin{itemize}
	\item Architecture decisions are rules for constructing systems. For example, database can only be accessed by the model layer in the MVC architecture.
	\end{itemize}
	
	\item Design principles
	\begin{itemize}
	\item Design principles are guidelines for constructing systems, e.g, whenever possible, use asynchronous messaging.
	\end{itemize}
	
	\end{itemize}
	\end{frame}
	
	\begin{frame}{The Job Description of A Software Architect}
	\begin{itemize}
	\item Make architecture decisions
	\item Continually analyze the architecture
	\item Keep current with latest trends
	\item Ensure compliance with decisions
	\item Diverse exposure and experience
	\item Have business domain knowledge
	\item Possess interpersonal skills
	\item Understand and navigate politics
	\end{itemize}
	\end{frame}
	
	\begin{frame}{Law of Software Architecture}
	\begin{itemize}
	\item Everything in software architecture is a trade-off.
	\item If architect thinks they have discovered something that is not a trade-off, more likely they just have not identified the trade-off yet.
	\item Why is more important than how.
	\end{itemize}
	\end{frame}
	
	\begin{frame}{Architectural Characteristics}
	\begin{itemize}
	\item Operational Characteristics
	\begin{itemize}
	\item Availability, continuity (disaster recovery), performance, recoverability, 
		reliability (1 - probability of failure), robustness, scalability
	\end{itemize}
	\item Structural Characteristics
	\begin{itemize}
	\item Configurability, extensibility, Installability, resusability, localization, maintainability, portability, supportability, Upgradeability
	\end{itemize}
	\item Cross-cutting Architecture Characteristics
	\begin{itemize}
	\item Accessibility, Archivability, authentication, authorization, legal, privacy, security,
	usability, supportability
	\end{itemize}
	\item ISO Characteristics
	\begin{itemize}
	\item performance efficiency, compatibility, usability, reliability, security, maintainability, portability, functional suitability (completeness, correctness, appropriateness)
	\end{itemize}
	\end{itemize}
	\end{frame}
